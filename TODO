* mf-include-as should prefix all targets with _ to make them private

* mf-build-static-library doesn't work well with mf-static-dependencies, since the latter usually includes .a files, and you cannot 'ar rcs' an archive into an archive.
** Maybe Add mf-build-object-files as a way to deal with the above ?

test-forge needs a better 'help' target that explains NOPARALLEL, etc.
